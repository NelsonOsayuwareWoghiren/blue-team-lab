# AWS Blue Team Lab

This repo contains evidence from my AWS Blue Team lab:
- CloudTrail CSV export
- Screenshot of AccessDenied event
- Security report (see report.pdf)

Lab demonstrates steps:
1. Deploy EC2 (terminated for cost savings)
2. Enable CloudTrail & CloudWatch
3. Simulate suspicious activity
4. Detect unauthorized access
5. Harden environment
- Security Report: AWS-Blue-Team-Lab-Report.pdf
